```
It's pretty sad when even the hometown paper is behind the greatcloudwall.
C'mon guys. Stop using Cloudflare.
It's endangering the world wide web and you're blocking readers who are protecting
their privacy by using Tor.
```
-- [Mr. Jeff Cliff, BSc ***PROFILE USES CLOUDFLARE***](https://shitposter.club/users/jeffcliff)  ([Issue 28: WTF Why is Jeff Cliff using Cloudflare website?](https://codeberg.org/crimeflare/cloudflare-tor/issues/28))


```
Man-in-the-middle attack is a serious offense.
If you′re using Cloudflare on your website, you won′t get first rank.
You shouldn′t use it if you value visitor′s privacy.
```
 -- [Crimeflare #Search](https://crimeflare.wodferndripvpe6ib4uz4rtngrnzichnirgn7t5x64gxcyroopbhsuqd.onion/) (aka Searxes)


```
There have been many cases of cloudflare denying people access to a website
without the website owner knowing.
I'm a legitimate user increasing my security by using a VPN but Cloudflare mistakenly
decides I'm a bot and denies access.
There have also been cases where Cloudflare just stops allowing anyone to visit a website
simply because they don't think anyone should be able to.

Regardless, that's not my main objection to Cloudflare.
As a "man in the middle", they get access to all of my traffic.
With the SSL certificates they provide, your connection is encrypted to Cloudflare then
decrypted and sent to the server. The lock icon in your browser means absolutely nothing
when a third party is literally getting all of your traffic when you connect to that site.
Beyond that, with so many sites using Cloudflare, cross-site tracking becomes a problem.

In addition, with so many websites behind Cloudflare, when it goes down, half the web is down.
The internet was designed to be decentralised and Cloudflare is centralising it.
Half of the internet relying on a single entity is dangerous.
```
-- [Amolith](https://social.nixnet.services/@Amolith)


```
Think about your visitors.
Do you like it when websites ruin a bit of your experience?
In other words: Would you love to visit a website which forces you
to solve a annoying timewasting puzzle usually after waiting five
seconds which also cost you valuable time?
Awesome! Use Cloudflare!
```
-- [Robin Wils](https://linuxrocks.online/@RMW)

```
I say it's a bad idea to pimp CloudFlare sites and expect such repressions to go unchallenged.
Activism is a duty & ethics trumps netiquette.

Posting original information exclusively on onion sites
is like affirmative action for the repressed Tor community.
Correcting the wrongs of CloudFlare entails some unfair discrimination against clearnet users.
```
-- [Activist](https://activism.openworlds.info/@aktivismoEstasMiaLuo/103923473080989041)

"i think it's key to know your audience. If the audience cares about corporations controlling ppl's lives, then stress the control-freakish aspects of CloudFlare like loss of netneutrality. If the audience is fine with corporate control, then stress CloudFlare's incompetence & stress the security detriment of having a single global centralized point of failure." ([batalanto](https://todon.nl/@batalanto/104660140613165269))

"Your premise that corporate-run svcs are equal is quite far from what I find. "Open access" is central to P2Pf's advocacy. CloudFlare is the single most destructive force to open access. Consider Amazon, for example. As evil as it is, AWS does not attack open access. CF does. So to paint all corporations the same through the lense of P2Pf's values is to cloud the problem." ([batalanto](https://todon.nl/@batalanto/104659761329232101))

"I believe getting our own house in order is a crtical first step. It's paramount for projects that exist for social justice pursuant to a free and open Internet to avoid CloudFlare themselves. It's not just a moral principle-- there's a practical problem when the operations of a social mission exclude their own advocates from access." ([batalanto](https://todon.nl/@batalanto/104653955377950930))

"spot on bob. CloudFlare has the most power, it's far too much, and unlike other tech giants ( Amazon), CF abuses their power to a perverse extent. Strypey, although I'd like to see CloudFlare wiped off the planet entirely, I'm particularly disturbed when those on a social mission that contradicts CF use CF for their mission. The hypocrisy is inexcusable & needs a spotlight of shame" ([batalanto](https://todon.nl/@batalanto/104653928066889916))

"gitlab.com used to be a nice place. But it feels really hostile these days. If you attempt to preserve a tiny bit of privacy by using Tor, they won't even let you take a look at public projects. Instead they'll harass you with CloudFlare captcha which is requiring JavaScript and trying to force users to build ML training data. (btw. it still works to fight hcaptcha by giving partially wrong answers)" ([uniq](https://chaos.social/@uniq/104652792387203024))


"ACM has been denying open public access to scientific papers anyway. Tor users are blocked because ACM has jailed their host in CloudFlare's walled garden: The ACM site is also set to give a 302 error to the InternetArchive waybackMachine.

"CloudFlare is evil. Let's be clear: the evil is not in business success. The evil is in their lies and deceptions, their surveillance capitalist business model, and their abuse of power in dictating the tools that may users use to protect their privacy. It's an injustice to make excuses for CF & for CF's users." ([aktivismoestasmialuo](https://activism.openworlds.info/@aktivismoEstasMiaLuo/104564791822534415))

"CloudFlare is the single biggest attack on the decentralized web.

"Today first I successfully did a search on opensubtitles.org with Firefox and noticed that this site uses CloudFlare. Then later on I tried to do a search on opensubtitles.org with the Tor browser. I got the Google ReCaptcha, and after solving that for more than 10 to 15 times, where it seemed to give me access a few times, I was still not able to perform a search at all (meh) :_catsad: When will people realize that the "free of charge" for 1 website DDOS protection by CloudFlare is not at all a cool and "free" option to choose for. It is more like selling your soul and poisoning the Internet. Also : A few months ago I had to use the CloudFlare web admin interface for a friend. I added a subdomain for an admin login page for the website of my friend. Then I continued working on the site and suddenly noticed in the logs that the brand new subdomain was visited by several different ones, including a tor node. At first I got confused by it, and I found it very unpleasant, but in the end my conclusion is that CloudFlare is just dodgy. I hope that affordable CDN and DDOS protection alternatives will grow and vanish CloudFlare in the end." [Ajz](https://mastodon.host/@Ajz)
